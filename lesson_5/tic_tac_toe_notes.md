# Object-oriented Approach Summary

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs

2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs into nouns and do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.

3. Optional - model thoughts into CRC (class-responsibilities-collaborators) cards
