# building off the previous LS solution using a module:

module Moveable
  attr_accessor :speed, :heading
  attr_writer :fuel_capacity, :fuel_efficiency

  def range
    @fuel_capacity * @fuel_efficiency
  end
end

class WheeledVehicle
  include Moveable

  def initialize(tire_array, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @tires = tire_array
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end

  def tire_pressure(tire_index)
    @tires[tire_index]
  end

  def inflate_tire(tire_index, pressure)
    @tires[tire_index] = pressure
  end
end

class Catamaran < Boat
  attr_reader :propeller_count, :hull_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    super(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    @num_propellers = num_propellers
    @num_hulls = num_hulls
    # ... other code to track catamaran-specific data omitted ...
  end
end

## we must also track a basic motorboat:

class Boat
  include Moveable

  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    self.fuel_efficiency = km_traveled_per_liter
    self.fuel_capacity = liters_of_fuel_capacity
  end
end

class Motorboat < Boat; end

## LS solution still gives Motorboat instance vars for hulls and propellers, just sets them to 1

class Seacraft
  include Moveable

  attr_reader :hull_count, :propeller_count

  def initialize(num_propellers, num_hulls, fuel_efficiency, fuel_capacity)
    @propeller_count = num_propellers
    @hull_count = num_hulls
    self.fuel_efficiency = fuel_efficiency
    self.fuel_capacity = fuel_capacity
  end
end

class Motorboat < Seacraft
  def initialize(km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
    # set up 1 hull and 1 propeller
    super(1, 1, km_traveled_per_liter, liters_of_fuel_capacity)
  end
end

class Catamaran < Seacraft
end
